REQUISITES:
-----------
1. A ceph source folder (I guess, version does not matter) that has been completely built.
2. A linux machine is needed to build this tool.

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Run 'make CEPH_SRCDIR=</path/to/ceph/src>' to build the tool
2. Run 'make clean' to clean
3. After building, an elf file named 'tool' will be created
4. Run 'tool --help' to see the usage information of the tool

Sample Output:
--------------
cdps$ ./tool --pool-info "pool 2 'rbd' rep size 2 min_size 1 crush_ruleset 0 object_hash rjenkins pg_num 128 pgp_num 128 last_change 1 owner 0" --image-info "rbd image 'babu':
size 10240 KB in 3 objects
order 22 (4096 KB objects)
block_name_prefix: rb.0.1008.74b0dc51
format: 1" --crushmap ../ceph/map.txt
